ac.text.CYBERSUS_BASIC_INFO.1= The question of increasing the capabilities of the body has always worried mankind, because by nature people do not have claws, sharp teeth or poison. Solving this problem pushed progress forward in the early periods of human development. To do this, people came up with digging sticks, horseradish staves, firearms and much more. But all these solutions do not correct the main drawback of a person as an organism - weak organs.
ac.text.CYBERSUS_BASIC_INFO.2=Realizing this, you decided to start studying the issue of strengthening your own body by replacing your "components" with more powerful variants of artificial origin. As a magician, you will surely find a way to combine flesh with steel. Your eyes are burning, but you feel that it is too easy to implement and do all this. It seems that such "upgrades" can hacve side effects...
ac.text.CYBERSUS_BASIC_INFO.3=Implants are installed through a special gui. Each implant has "abilities" that can be activated via the corresponding buttons. Abilities are mainly divided into Instant (instant action), Passive (after switching on, they start working on the background), and Distorting (used on creatures. Upon activation, the distortion process begins, after which the action takes place. If at the same time you lose sight of the target or it is blocked by blocks, you are given a certain time specified near the distortion window to return the target to the field of view). Any ability doesn't work for free- it needs fuel. It can be anything - liquid essence, blood from a bloody network, witch infusion, and even some kind of energy from your favorite fellow techies like RF. All details will be given in the description of the ability itself
ac.text.SHADOW_SKIN.1= The most ancient human fear is the fear of the unknown. And it, in turn, is born where nothing can be seen. You have created an implant that envelops and seals you, pressing you into darkness. Being in dark place, you can go into the shadows, becoming invulnerable to direct attacks and losing the ability to interact with the outside world. However, you are vulnerable to flames and any damage of this type will lead to fatal consequences. Moreover, if you find yourself in a bright enough place, you will literally be squeezed out of the darkness, which you definitely do not want. To activate, the implant requires 64 tenebrae and 2 more tenebrae each tick in the enabled state
ac.text.PORTABLE_ASPECT_HOLDERS.1=For the implants to work, as mentioned earlier, you need fuel, which somehow needs to be carried with you. In the case of blood in the blood network or with infusion, everything is clear - they are always with you. But with essence, problems begin. Therefore, you have created a portable container that is able to hold the essence under enormous pressure. 2 variants have been developed, the first holds only one aspect, but its limit is 1024 units, and the second holds 128 units of essence of the same type, but these types can be up to 8.
ac.text.PORTABLE_ASPECT_HOLDERS.2=To use, press the RMB through the air, a menu will open in front of you. Select the aspect you want to work with, and enter the quantity in the field above. Now, if you just click on any essence storage, the container will try to take the specified amount of the specified aspect, if you sit down when you click, on the contrary, it will try to give this amount from its storage. The current number of aspects is written in the menu above each of them.
ac.text.BLANK_HEART.1=The first thing that comes to mind is to replace the heart. It is the power supply unit of the whole body, and replacing it with a more powerful one will strengthen the whole body as a whole. But something has to become the core, the battery for the heart itself. As an advanced thaumaturge, you know of one very powerful source of pure energy - the pearl. By plastering it with hollow metal for elasticity, you have received a completely working replacement for your heart
ac.text.GRAVITY_INCREASER.1=Nature rules of world has always attracted you and immersed you in thought. The primordial-and, oddly enough, weak-interaction is gravitational. Not only is it uncontrollable, but it makes little sense - for a noticeable effect, mutually attractive objects must be extremely huge, like the Earth and the Moon. But magic knows no boundaries, and therefore, for your own selfish purposes, you have created an implant that allows you to create an area of enhanced gravity. <BR>When turned on, it creates a gravitational area in the direction of your gaze, 64 Gravitas and 16 Dimensio are needed to create
ac.text.BLANK_MOTHERBOARD.1=Your tech friends achieve their goals with the help of pros and cons, zeros and ones. Your path lies through a magic wand and nauseating potions. Nevertheless, why not take some of the ideas from your colleagues? Taking a brain that is not the freshest, "spreading" it over the surface of a random tablet and sticking gold tracks at random, you got quite a calculating detail capable of processing something and ... strangely enough, influencing space-time. The magical waves emitted by the mind of creatures do not disappear without a trace, and can interact with the environment, changing reality.
ac.text.BERSERK_HEART.1=When improving the heart, the simplest thing that comes to mind is to increase blood flow and supply useful minerals or substances directly into the blood in emergency situations. The result of your efforts was the heart of a berserker - the less health you have, the more your blood boils, your consciousness becomes foggy, and the sword craves blood. For inclusion and further maintenance every second, the implant, depending on your level of health, requires from 0 to 16 units of the following aspects: Tutamen, Sano, Potentia, and ((Ignis and Telum) or Ira)
ac.text.SIN_HEART.1=7 images of human behavior leading to disastrous consequences are called the "Seven Deadly Sins". The mind longs for the fulfillment of its passionate desires, but moral and ethical norms restrain you. Anyway, you decided to try to collect a concentrate of one of these emotions right in the core of your body - in the heart. Turning on the implant, unclean fluid begins to run through your veins, and you feel that you are no longer able to control yourself... You are in pain, scared, and something is tearing you to pieces from the inside. Horns grow out of your head, wings grow out of your back, generated by the shape of your corrupted mind. And you can get rid of excruciating pain only by satisfying your base desires...
ac.text.SIN_HEART.2=Depending on the aspect that was used in filling the heart, you get different advantages and disadvantages. <BR>§nEnvy§r<BR> You can no longer tolerate that anyone is better than you. When attacking essentially, your damage increases briefly depending on how many times the target has more health than you do. <BR>§nPride§r<BR> You can finally revel in your superiority over the weak, and rule the world. When attacking essentially, your damage increases briefly depending on how many times you have more health than the target.
ac.text.SIN_HEART.3=§nSloth§r<BR> You are tired of making any effort, you want everything to fall into your hands by itself. By ignoring attacks on you, you accumulate a charge that will be released on your next attack, causing increased damage <BR>§nRage§r<BR> Your eyes are bloodshot, your hands are trembling with thirst for slaughter, and you revel in it. With a series of attacks, your damage increases with each subsequent attack.
ac.text.SIN_HEART.4=§nLust§r<BR> Lustful desires flood your mind, but you are no longer ashamed of it, but are proud and use it for good. Consecutive attacks on the same creature are accelerated. <BR>§nGluttony§r<BR> The boundless feeling of hunger absorbs even thoughts, overshadows the mind. You... want... MORE... MORE!!! You start to starve, but attacks on creatures make up for your satiety and heal you. Activating any type of ability costs 256 of the corresponding aspect. Maintaining a sinful form costs 16 aspects per second
ac.text.TORMENTOR.1=The spells you have learned are truly terrible - the world of torment is a creepy place. However, it is very difficult to put this spell into practice, it is very difficult for them to get in. Therefore, you have created an implant that allows you to send your target into a world of torment. For use requires 16 Iter, 16 Vinculum, 16 Spiritus and (16 Ira or (16 Ignis and 16 Telum))
ac.text.SLEEP_MODULE.1=Potion-making is, of course, an interesting thing, but imperfect. An example of this is the sleep potion. When taking it inside, not all the contents actually have an effect, while it results in an extra expenditure of useful resources. Therefore, using modern technology, you have created an implant that directly allows you to go to sleep. For use, the ability of the implant requires 8 Dimensio, and ((8 Vinculum and 8 Spiritus) or 8 Desidia)

ac.text.CYBERSUS_BASIC_INFO.3=Implants are installed through a special gui. Each implant has "abilities" that can be activated via the corresponding buttons. Abilities are mainly divided into Instant (instant action), Passive (after switching on, they start working on the background), and Distorting (used on creatures. Upon activation, the distortion process begins, after which the action takes place. If at the same time you lose sight of the target or it is blocked by blocks, you are given a certain time specified near the distortion window to return the target to the field of view). Any ability doesn't work for free - it needs fuel. It can be anything - liquid essence, blood from a bloody network, witch infusion, and even some kind of energy from your favorite fellow techies like RF. All details will be given in the description of the ability itself
ac.text.PHOENIX_HEART.1= Legends about a bird reborn in fire have been around since ancient times. You have studied this question and tried to get the ability of this mysterious bird. <BR>When turned on, the implant will save you from death, after which it will go into recharge. For the resurrection, he will take 712 Victus, 128 Ignis and 128 Permutatio. Please note that if you run out of fuel, you will not be resurrected.
ac.text.BLANK_EYE.1=Eye implantation is, maybe, the most complicated part of all implantation. To make human neurons connect with steel can be a real challenge. However, you have done it (yuo still do not understand how)
ac.text.MIND_EXPLODER.1=Ability to influence on space-time can be used in different cases... But there is one cruel way to abuse it - influence your target's mind. <BR>Focusing your victim will end up with explosion and fatal mental damaged caused to target. To work, it requires 256 Perditio and (256 Ira or (256 Telum and 256 Ignis))
ac.text.ILLUSION_GENERATOR.1=Speaking of the distortion of space-time and mind, one of the most obvious ideas that comes to mind is to trick the victim's brain, overflowing it with unnecessary information and forcing it to see something that is not really there, or distort its vision of the world. <BR> When used, the illusion generator will begin to distort the target's mind, and when completed, the victim will temporarily see your illusory copies, confusing her and making it difficult to determine your exact location. <BR> Requires 128 Cognitio and 128 Perdition to use
